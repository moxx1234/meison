Fully adaptive single page website for real estate company

To build the project I had used pure HTML with semantic tags, SASS preprocessor, BEM mothodology, native JS, google maps api, SwiperJS library. Relative units and media queries and some JavaScript had been used to adapt the page. The project was build on GULP

My first project using GULP. 

While creating this page I have been learning on scroll animations using intersecitonObserver, forms validation. My first contact with google cloud api's and SwiperJS library
